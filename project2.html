                <h2>Dataset Description</h2>
                    The dataset consists of 8 .CSV files representing different business operations:<br />                
                    <b>Customers</b> – Customer profiles with contact details.<br />
                    <b>Orders</b> – Sales transactions, including order dates and total amounts.<br />
                    <b>Order Items</b> – Individual products purchased within each order.<br />
                    <b>Payments</b> – Payment methods and transaction statuses.<br />
                    <b>Products</b> – Product catalog, including pricing and supplier details.<br />
                    <b>Reviews</b> – Customer ratings and feedback on purchases.<br />
                    <b>Shipments</b> – Shipment tracking details, including delivery times.<br />
                    <b>Suppliers</b> – Supplier information for product sourcing.<br />            
                    The dataset required cleaning before analysis, ensuring accurate insights.<br />
                    <br />
                <h2>Analysis Steps</h2>

               <h3>1️⃣ Defining the Business Questions</h3>
               The first step was to explore the data from a business perspective, identifying valuable insights that could drive decision-making. By examining sales, customer behavior, supplier performance, and delivery trends, I determined how these datasets connect and what patterns could be uncovered. This ensured the analysis provided actionable insights rather than just beautiful sets of visual with low added value.<br />
               <br />   
               <h3>2️⃣ Data Cleaning & Transformation (ETL with Python)</h3>
                    Before analysis, the raw dataset was processed using Python (Pandas, NumPy):<br />

                    ✔ Checked for inconsistencies in data types (dates stored as text, missing numeric values).<br />
                    ✔ Standardized column names for consistency across datasets.<br />
                    ✔ Handled null values by filling missing data appropriately.<br />
                    ✔ Removed duplicate records for better accuracy.<br />
                    ✔ Fixed inconsistent data patterns (e.g., phone numbers, supplier codes).<br />
                    You can find the Python code I used for data cleaning in My GitHub profile by clicking <a href="https://github.com/M-Mortazavi/PowerBI-Business-Insights/blob/main/Ecommerce-Data-Cleaning.py"><b>HERE</b>.</a></p>

            </div>
               <br />
               <h3>3️⃣ Data Modeling in Power BI</h3>
               The data is structured using a Snowflake Schema, with Orders as the central fact table, linking to Order Items, Payments, and Shipments for transaction details.<br />

                Dimension tables provide business context:<br />

                Customers connect to Orders and Reviews, linking purchases to feedback.<br />
                Products relate to Order Items, Reviews, and Suppliers, enabling analysis of sales, supplier performance, and ratings.<br />
                Shipments and Payments are linked to Orders for fulfillment and transaction tracking.<br />
                This normalized structure optimizes performance while allowing for detailed trend analysis and flexible filtering across multiple business dimensions.<br />

               <br />

               <h3>4️⃣ Adding Key Calculated Measures (DAX)</h3>
               Advanced DAX formulas were created to track performance:<br />

                ✔ Promotion Expenses → (Price - Price at Purchase) * Quantity<br />
                ✔ Order Fulfillment Time → (Order Date - Shipment Date)<br />
                ✔ Delta Sales → Sales growth compared to the previous period.<br />
                ✔ MTD (Month-to-Date) Sales → Tracks sales progress within the current month.<br />
                ✔ YTD (Year-to-Date) Sales → Aggregates total sales for the current year.<br />
                ✔ Last 30 Days Sales → Provides recent sales trends.<br />
                ✔ AOV (Average Order Value) → Adjusts dynamically based on slicer selections.<br />
                ✔ Order Frequency Trend → Measures how frequently customers make purchases.<br />
                ✔ Sales & Sales Evolution Per Category → Compares product categories over time.<br />
                ✔ Delivery Average Time → Calculates the average time taken to deliver orders.<br />
                ✔ Successful Payment Ratio → Measures the proportion of successfully completed transactions.<br />
                ✔ Average Shipment Days → Tracks the efficiency of shipments.<br />
                ✔ Suppliers Sales Share → Determines each supplier's contribution to overall revenue.<br />
                ✔ New Customer Sales Ratio → Analyzes the share of revenue from first-time buyers.<br />
               <br />

               <h3>5️⃣ Visualization & Dashboard Creation in Power BI</h3>
                This interactive Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive view of sales performance, customer behavior, and supplier efficiency, enabling data-driven decision-making.<br />
                <br />

               <iframe title="Ecommerce-V1-Share Public" width="800" height="500.5" src="https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiZTFhMDM5YjEtNDgwNi00NGFmLWI2MTctYTI5ZjllZGUxMzFkIiwidCI6Ijc5NWY0ZTE1LWNlNmQtNGEwNC04YTY5LWJlNWY3YTU0OGFiYSJ9" frameborder="0" allowFullScreen="true"></iframe>
               <br /> 
               Sharing Power BI dashboards with a free license can be challenging, and it took me a week to find a working solution. Since Power BI Publish to Web is often restricted, I had to set up a Microsoft Business trial account with admin access to enable public sharing.<br />
               <br />
                📌 <b>Guide to Share a Power BI Dashboard for Free:</b><br />
                1- Create a Microsoft Business Account (to have Admin Access to Power BI account)

                Sign up for a trial Microsoft 365 Business account : 
                <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/business/compare-all-microsoft-365-business-products"> Mirosoft account registration link</a><br />
            
                Even after the trial expires, you keep Power BI access (but the Microsoft 365 account deactivates).<br />
                <br />
                2- Upload & Open the Dashboard in Power BI Service<br />

                Sign in to Power BI Service using the same Microsoft 365 account.<br />
                Load your Power BI report into the Power BI workspace.<br />
                <br />
                3- Enable Public Sharing in Power BI Admin Settings<br />

                Go to Settings → Admin Portal.<br />
                In Export and Sharing Settings, enable Publish to Web.<br />
                Disable "Block Public Internet Access" to allow external sharing.<br />
                <br />
               4- Generate a Public Link for the Dashboard<br />

                Open your report in Power BI Service.<br />
                Click File → Embed Report → Publish to Web.<br />
                Copy the public link and share it!<br />
                ⚠ Important: This method creates a public link, meaning anyone with the link can access the dashboard. It is not suitable for sensitive or company data.
               <br />    
               <br /> 
               I designed this project to showcase how data analytics, Python, and Power BI can transform raw data into actionable business insights. By implementing advanced ETL, data modeling, and interactive visualizations, I created a dynamic dashboard that empowers decision-making. Explore the insights, interact with the data, and uncover trends that drive business success!<br />
